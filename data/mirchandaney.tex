The goal of the SpiniFEL project was to write, from scratch, a single particle imaging code for exascale supercomputers. The original vision was to have two versions of the code, one in MPI and one in Pygion, a Python-based interface to the Legion task-based runtime. We describe the motivation for the project, some of the programming challenges we encountered along the way, what worked and what didn't, and why only the Pygion code eventually ran at scale.
