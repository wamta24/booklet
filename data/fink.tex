Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) systems offer promising productivity and performance benefits to the MPI+X paradigm. These systems eschew the process-centric view of MPI, instead offering hierarchical execution and scheduling, more closely matching today's heterogeneous systems. These systems execute multiple tasks by picking them from a queue. Because different messages have different purposes and priorities, AMT implementors introduce multiple bespoke message queues. This decision introduces complex trade-offs, such as the order in which queues are checked, that affect application performance. Moreover, most application messages use a subset of the queues available in the AMT system, and application cycles are wasted checking empty queues.

To overcome these issues, we introduce registration-based queueing, where users register the message queues needed for their application, and only these queues are checked during application runtime. Moreover, we introduce an API that lets users control how often each message queue is checked. We implement registration-based queueing in the Charm++ runtime system, and demonstrate its performance impact in a variety of different contexts, demonstrating the substantial benefits of registration-based queueing in AMT systems.
