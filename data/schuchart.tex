Block-sparse matrix-matrix multiplication is an important operation in many scientific fields, including quantum physics and general tensor operations. Template Task Graph (TTG) is a programming model for flowgraph-based composition of high-performance algorithms executable on distributed heterogeneous computer platforms. The TTG API abstracts out the details of the underlying task and data flow runtime. This paper describes the implementation of 2.5D SUMMA (Scalable Universal Matrix Multiplication Algorithm) in the Template Task Graph (TTG) programming model. We will discuss the structure of the task graph and the operations involved, including strategies for controling the distribution of matrix blocks. We will provide a performance evaluation of our implementation and briefly discuss our intended approach for future support of accelerators.
