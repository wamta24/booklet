We present a collection of parallel codes in various programming languages covering common uses and implementations of mutual exclusion. This provides us with a basis for evaluating existing parallel systems for speed and efficiency, and a robust test suite for evaluating the correctness of new parallel systems. We also present benchmark results comparing the performance of the std:: and hpx:: libraries. We will make the suite publicly available and make available a process for accepting new submissions.
