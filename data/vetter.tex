DOE has just deployed its first Exascale system at ORNL, so now is an appropriate time to revisit our Exascale predictions from over a decade ago and think about post-Exascale. We are now seeing a Cambrian explosion of new technologies during this ‘golden age of architectures,’ making codesign of architectures with software and applications more critical than ever. In this talk, I will revisit the Exascale trajectory, survey post-Exascale technologies, and discuss their implications for both system design and software. As an example, I will describe Abisko, a new microelectronics codesign project, that focuses on designing a chiplet for analog spiking neural networks using novel neuromorphic materials like electrochemical random access memory.
