MatRIS is a multilevel math library abstraction for scalable and performance-portable sparse/dense BLAS/LAPACK operations. Including IRIS task-based runtime at the bottom level, MatRIS exposes three levels of abstraction to make the tiled algorithms completely architecture agnostic. MatRIS ensures the decomposition and creation of tasks that represent the necessary encapsulation of the optimized kernels from the vendor and open-source math libraries. Once built, MatRIS can select different combinations of accelerators at runtime, which in turn makes it portable to diverse heterogeneous architectures. Using the features of managing heterogeneity of IRIS runtime, MatRIS algorithms exclude the need to specify any orchestration and data transfer. In this study, we provide insight into how serial task abstraction of tiled Cholesky factorization of MatRIS is made portable and scalable in the case of multi-device and multi-vendor heterogeneity on different heterogeneous systems, including a cloud node with NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
