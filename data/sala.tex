As transistor density improvements plateau, cost-effective high-density chip production becomes challenging. Computer systems are overcoming these limitations by including multiple accelerators. Concurrently, exploiting parallelism in distributed and heterogeneous systems remains challenging. Task-based programming models are a promising alternative to exploit complex systems. However, integrating different communication, offloading and storage APIs within tasks poses performance and deadlock risks. Several Task-Aware libraries, such as TAMPI, TAGASPI, TACUDA, TASYCL and TACUDA, have been developed to integrate blocking and non-blocking APIs with task-based programming models efficiently. In this paper, we introduce the Asynchronous Low-level Programming Interface (ALPI) to enable the interoperability and portability of Task-Aware libraries across various programming models and runtime systems. We present ALPI's implementation within the Nanos6 runtime and nOS-V library, which facilitates the integration of Task-Aware libraries into OmpSs-2 and OpenMP programming models, respectively. This work presents a step toward improving the portability and interoperability of Task-Aware libraries across different programming models and runtime systems.
