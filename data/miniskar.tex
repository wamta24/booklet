Task based programming models are getting higher traction in scientific computing. IRIS is a portable runtime system exploiting multiple heterogeneous programming systems and can discover available resources, manage multiple diverse programming systems (e.g., CUDA, Hexagon, HIP, Level Zero, OpenCL, and OpenMP) simultaneously. It takes constraints of task dependencies and provide customizable scheduling policies to map the tasks to heterogeneous devices. In this paper, we present new capabilities added to the IRIS to make it highly portable, easy heterogeneous programming, build friendly and performance efficient. The capabilities include the addition of vendor specific kernels support, runtime system with foreign function interface to eliminate to write wrapper/boiler-plate code for heterogeneous kernels, easy and configurable CMake based build environment, and automatic and efficient data transfers and orchestration.
