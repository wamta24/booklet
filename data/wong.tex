Programming for todayâ€™s quantum computers is making significant strides toward modern HPC compatible workflows, but key challenges still face the field. Quantum computing programming languages share some common ground, as well as their emerging runtimes and algorithmic modalities. In this short paper, we propose a refinement of the quantum processing unit (QPU) in order to understand the value it can play in linking QC with HPC and through some hypothetical examples, how its potential for scientific discovery might be realized.
