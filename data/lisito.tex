With the ever-growing number of cores per node, it is critical for
runtime systems and applications to adapt the task granularity to scale
on recent architectures. Among applications, sparse direct solvers are a
time-consuming step and the task granularity is rarely adapted to large
many-core systems. In this paper, we investigate the use of runtime
systems to automatically partition tasks in order to achieve more
parallelism and refine the task granularity. Experiments are conducted
on the new version of the PaStiX solver, which has been completely
rewritten to better integrate modern task-based runtime systems. The
results demonstrate the increase in scalability achieved by the solver
thanks to the adaptive task granularity provided by the StarPU runtime
system.
